# pySnake.py


## Description

This is a simple reproduction of the [Snake with Pygame](!https://pythonspot.com/snake-with-pygame/) tutorial. Once the tutorial and thus the simplest version of the game is understand I will be adding new features

### 01/04/2019 

Decided to change the approach. The tutorial uses an image to create the serpent while I want to do it without need any external source (apart from python). Clean repo then.

## Project organization

Firstly, fully understand the project proposed and fix any eventual bug found, fully describing how the code works. Once this is done, features can be added. The start of the project was good to understand how to use classes in python. Now, I am changing the approach and doing by myself the project. The project development should then follow this steps:

1. Create a map to understand how to create graphics using python (may be intialy on the terminal)
2. Create the different components of the game (snake and apple)
3. Allow to move the snake and eat the apple (getting bigger)
4. Create a random/pseudo-random generator for the apple
5. Create score board
6. Create a menu with multiple speeds
7. Increase the speed each time the apple is eaten
8. Create obstacles and rewards (better apple after eating 5 apples in a row that last some seconds on the map)

## Current features

None

## Future features/Under development

* Creating screen and esc to exit
