Monster and archer can be created, I intend to create a single class that is called creature. So it would be the mother class for both player and monster

## Project organization

Firstly I wanted to create a player and monster. Now I can maybe create a mother class called **creature** to help out. I have created a way to save the player, need to load the player if I want to. After that I can start to look for weapon, spells, mana points, etc.

1. Create player **DONE**
2. Create monster **DONE**
3. Do a game loop **DONE**
4. Create a mother class
5. Create advantages to each profession
