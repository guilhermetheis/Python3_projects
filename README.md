# Python Projects

This is my python3 applications repository, each folder should contain a different application with a own README explaining its operation.

### Working Projects

Those are the projects that I've already made and validated. Issues should be opened if there is some bug. 

* **eagleBOM**: this script allows the automatization of an eagle created BOM file.

### Ongoing Projects

Those are the projects I am working right now

## Projects ideas

This is a wide range of ideas I have found while looking to how to learn how to code, feel free to suggest anything if you want in the issues section.
