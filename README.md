# Python3_projects

This is my python3 applications repository, each folder should contain a different application with a own README containing instructions/information about the project itself

## Projects

* eagleBOM: this script allows the automatization of an eagle created BOM file. The fully explanation to how to set up eagle and run the program is explained in the README from the project folder.

## Projects ideas

This is a wide range of ideas I have found while looking to how to learn how to code
